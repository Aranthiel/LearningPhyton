<p></p><h2>Debugging under IDLE</h2>

<p>IDLE has a debugger built into it.  It is very useful
for stepping through a program and watching the variables
change values.

</p><p>Start IDLE and open <a href="https://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/help/debug-tutorial/volume.py">this</a> program 
source file.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/openfile.jpg">
</p><hr>
<p>In the Shell window, click on the Debug menu option at
the top and then on Debugger.
You will see a "Debug Control" window like this </p><p><img src="debug_archivos/debugon.jpg">
<br>Notice that the Shell shows "[DEBUG ON]".
</p><hr>
<p>For the debugger to be most useful, you need to set a breakpoint in your
source code before you start running the program.
A breakpoint is a marker on your code that tells the debugger
"run to this point at normal speed, then pause and let the
human have control".  You can have many of them; in more
complex programs you would need them at different places.  
RIGHT click on a line of your source and choose "set breakpoint".
<br><img src="debug_archivos/setbreakpoint.jpg">
<br>The background of the line you click on turns yellow to show the
line marked with the breakpoint.
</p><hr>
<p><img src="debug_archivos/breakpointset.jpg">
</p><p>If you don't put any breakpoints in your source, when you run it
with the debugger on, it will pause at the first line of executable
code (may be an import statement or a call to main()) but then
will run your program normally (i.e. with no pauses).
</p><hr>
<p>Now run the program with F5 as usual.

</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/afterF5.jpg"> 
</p><p>Note that the Debug Control window
is opened and that the blue line states that the
line "from math import pi" is ready 
to be executed (the 7 is for line number 7
in the source file).
</p><p>From this point you can click the <b>Go</b> button near the top of
the window.  This will make the program run at normal speed until
a breakpoint is encountered (or input is requested or the program finishes).
You can also use the <b>Step</b> button to step through your code,
one line at a time.  This button is used quite a lot.
If the line being stepped through has a function call, 
execution will go to the first line of the function definition
(you are "stepping into" the function).
If the line being stepped through doesn't have a function call,
the line is executed.  In either case, then control goes back to the human.
</p><p>When you execute a line that has input in it, the debugger
seems to shut down but it has not.  If you bring up the Shell window
you can see that the program is waiting for input.
Make sure your cursor is in the right place on the window
and give it some input and press Enter as usual.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/localvariable.jpg">
</p><p>There are several things to note about this picture.
The Shell window is in the background, it shows that the
user entered 23 and pressed Enter.  The Debug Control window
shows that execution has moved on to the next line of code.
Also, at the bottom of that window there is a pane that says
"Locals" and it shows the value of radius to be '23'.
This is useful in several ways.  It shows the values of 
variables as they change, and it shows the <b>types</b>
of variables.  Note that the value of radius has quotes around it.
This means that it is a string value.
</p><p>Click the <b>Step</b> button again.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/anotherstep.jpg">
</p><p>Note that the new variable height has been created and has a
value of '14'.
</p><p>Click the <b>Step</b> button again.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/thirdstep-error.jpg">
</p><p>Notice that there is an error in the run of the program
at this point (the yellow bar in the Debug Control window).  
The interpreter is saying that it cannot
multiply "sequence by non-int of type 'float'".
What it means is that the two input variables are of the
wrong type to be combined with numeric types.
This has to be corrected before any more debugging takes place.
This is fixed by using the eval function in the two input statements.


</p><p>
"You can only toggle the debugger when idle"
If you get this message in a window when you try to turn
the debugger on, try clicking on the <b>Quit</b> button
in the Debug Control window.  If that
does not help, try shutting down the program file and
reopening it.  If that does not help, shut down Python completely
and restart it from scratch.

</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/onebugfixed.jpg"></p><p>Note that the bugs in the
input statements have been fixed with the addition of "eval".
The breakpoint was put in again.  Breakpoint locations are not
saved with the program; they have to be set again for every
debugging session.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/fixed-bug.jpg"></p><p>Note the type of the Local variables
in this image.  They don't have the quotes around the values any more!
They are numbers now.
</p><p>As you step through the program one statement at a time,
you can see more variables get values.
When we come to the next bug 
you can see that the variable Pi is not the same as
the variable pi, which is defined in the math library.
This bug would need to be fixed, then the debugging
would continue.
</p><p><img src="debug_archivos/nextbug.jpg">
</p><p>So the process of using the debugger involves
</p><ul>
<li>setting breakpoints 
</li><li>stepping through the source code one line at a time
</li><li>inspecting the values of variables as they change
</li><li>making corrections to the source  as bugs are found
</li><li>rerunning the program to make sure the fixes are correct
</li></ul>

<p>Explanations of a few other things in the Debug Control window
</p><ul>
<li><b>Over</b> means that if the statement to be executed has
a function call in it, go off and do the function call without
showing any details of the execution or variables, then return
and give the human control again, "step over the function"
</li><li><b>Out</b> assumes you are in some function's code, finish
execution of the function at normal speed, return from the function
and then give the human control again, "step out of the function"
</li><li><b>Quit</b> stops the execution of the entire program
</li></ul>
